Subject: A Taxonomy of P2P SIP Architectures

BACKGROUND
There's been a lot of interest in and outside the IETF in what's
called "Peer-to-Peer SIP". Unfortunately, there's not wide agreement
on what that actually means and the discussion tends to get bogged
down in implementation details about DHTs. This document is an attempt
to describe the various abstract system architectures that one
could be interested in supporting.


SIMPLIFIED CURRENT SIP ARCHITECTURE
The architecture of your basic SIP system looks something like this:


                   +-------------+
                   |  Registrar/ |
                   | Proxy, ...  | 
                   +-------------+
                     |    |    |
        +------------+    |    +------------+
        |                 |                 |
    +-------+         +-------+         +-------+
    |  UA   |         |  UA   |         |  UA   |
    +-------+         +-------+         +-------+


Operationally this means that in order to deploy a SIP-based VoIP
service you need to stand up a server (or cluster of servers)
to act as a registrar and proxy. This server (or group of servers)
provides some or all of the following important functions:

- Allows the user to register their location
- Allows callers to lookup the user's location
- NAT/Firewall traversal for signalling
- NAT/Firewall traversal for media

I think most of these are fairly obvious, but because the location
service has been the topic of so much discussion, I wanted to recap
how things currently work. When a UA wants to call someone, it 
goes through the following procedure:

1. Lookup the RHS of the AOR in the DNS.
2. Contact the proxy server that it gets in response.
3. The proxy server
