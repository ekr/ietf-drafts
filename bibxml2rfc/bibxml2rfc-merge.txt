BIBXML2RFC-MERGE(1)

NAME
     bibxml2rfc-merge -- merge a bibliography made with bibxml2rfc
     		         into the main XML file for submission

SYNOPSIS
     bibxmlrfc-merge infile [outfile]

DESCRIPTION
     XML files with bibliographies prepared with bibxml2rfc
     refer to supplemental bibliography files created in
     the same directory and therefore cannot be submitted
     directly in compilable form. bibxml2rfc-merge merges
     the files into a single file for submission.

     If only one filename is provided, the file is merged
     in place with the original file renamed <file>.orig.
     If two filenames are provided, the merged file is
     placed in the second filename.

BUGS
     bibxml2rfc-merge will not work unless you use the exact entity
     names specified in the bibxml2rfc(1) documentation.
