BIBXML2RFC(1)

NAME
     bibxml2rfc -- build a bibliography for an xml2rfc file

SYNOPSIS
     bibxml2rfc [-ci] file

DESCRIPTION
     bibxml2rfc is a bibliography helper program for xml2rfc files.
     One of the motivations for bibxml2rfc is that it's hard
     to work with xml2rfc in offline settings. Either you need
     to download the entire database or manually enter each
     database entry. In either case, you need to significantly
     edit your XML file to add a new reference. bibxml2rfc
     is intended to mitigate these issues.
     
     When handed an XML file, bibxml2rfc tries to identify the
     references and construct an appropriate bibliography. The
     general procedure is as follows:
     
     - Find all <xref> elements in the XML file (<file>)
     - Extract the "target" attributes.
     - Look in the local bibliography cache (references/) for files
       named <target>.xml.
     - If no cached entry is found or the the target appears to be
       an I-D (starts with "I-D."), then try to fetch an entry out
       of the appropriate repository on xml.resource.org.
     - Build two files:
       + <file>-normative containing reference entries for the
         normative references
       + <file>-informative containing reference entries for the
         informative references
     
     bibxml2rfc determines whether a reference is normative or
     informative by looking at the 'norm' attribute in the <xref>
     element. If it is 'true', then the reference is normative.
     Note that a single instance of 'norm="true"' is sufficient
     to mark a reference normative, so if multiple <xref> elements
     are present, only one need be so marked.


     AUTOMATIC INCORPORATION
     In order to take full advantage of bibxml2rfc, it is best
     to modify your XML file to incorporate the files it generates
     automatically. In the prologue add:
     
          <!ENTITY informative SYSTEM "x.xml-informative">
          <!ENTITY normative SYSTEM "x.xml-normative">
     
     And then in the Normative and Informative references sections,
     reference these entities, like so:
     
         <references title="Normative References">
           &normative;
         </references>;
     
         <references title="Informative References">
           &informative;
         </references>
     
     Once you have done this, you can leave your XML file alone and
     rely solely on bibxml2rfc.


     ADDING NEW ENTRIES
     bibxml2rfc will automatically retrieve anything that appears
     to be a reference to an RFC or I-D. This is done by looking for
     references with targets starting with "RFC" or "I-D". However,
     if you want to reference non-RFCs, you need only place an
     appropriate file in the references/ directory. E.g., to create
     a reference with anchor "ER08", just create a file named
     "references/ER08.xml" with an appropriate <reference> element
     in it.
     
     In addition, you can simply copy the XML references database
     into references/ and bibxml2rfc will automatically pick
     it up.


     SYNTHETIC ENTRIES
     If you haven't copied the references database into references/
     (or if you don't have a recent copy) you may find while working
     offline that an entry is not found and you will not be able
     to run xml2rfc. bibxml2rfc can automatically create synthetic
     entries to compensate for this issue. If you provide the 
     '-i' flag, bibxml2rfc will make synthetic biblio entries for
     any reference starting with "I-D" or "RFC". Note that these
     synthetic entries do not get cached, so if you rerun bibxml2rfc,
     they don't interfere with its operation.

     Note that we don't try to create synthetic entries for any
     other missing references. There are two primary reasons:

     - bibxml2rfc doesn't know how to fetch them anyway, so we
       assume you'll fill them in for yourself.  
     - xml2rfc doesn't distinguish between citations and crossreferences
       the way LaTeX does, so we don't want to create synthetic
       references for crossreferences

BUGS
     bibxml2rfc is pretty stupid about any reference that doesn't
     have a name that fits the expected format. Luckily, this is
     the format used by the online repository.
