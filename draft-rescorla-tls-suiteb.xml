               <t>The United States Government has published
               guidelines for "NSA Suite B Cryptography" dated July, 2005,
	       which defines cryptographic algorithm polcy

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>
In July, 2005 the National
Security Agency posted "Fact Sheet, NSA Suite B Cryptography" which
stated:
<artwork>
    To complement the existing policy for the use of the Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES) to protect national security systems
    and information as specified in The National Policy on the use of
    the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to Protect National
    Security Systems and National Security Information (CNSSP-15),
    the National Security Agency (NSA) announced Suite B Cryptography
    at the 2005 RSA Conference.  In addition to the AES, Suite B
    includes cryptographic algorithms for hashing, digital
    signatures, and key exchange.

    Suite B only specifies the cryptographic algorithms to be
    used. Many other factors need to be addressed in determining
    whether a particular device implementing a particular set of
    cryptographic algorithms should be used to satisfy a particular
    requirement.  
</artwork>
</t>
<t>
Among those factors are "requirements for interoperability both
domestically and internationally".
</t>
<t>
This document is a profile of of TLS 1.2 <xref
target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"/> and of the cipher suites defined
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-ecc-new-mac"/>, but does not itself define
any new cipher suites. This profile requires TLS 1.2.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Conventions Used In This Document">
  <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
    target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
</section>
 
<section title="Suite B Requirements">
<t>
The "Suite B Fact Sheet" requires that key establishment and authentication
algorithms be based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography, that the encryption
algorithm be AES <xref target="AES"/>, and that the function used for key derivation and
data integrity be SHA <xref target="SHS"/>. It defines two security levels, of 128 and
192 bits. 
</t>
<t>
In particular it states:
</t>
<t>
</t>
<list style="empty">
<t>
SUITE B includes:
<artwork>
     Encryption:          Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)  -
                          FIPS 197 (with keys sizes of 128 and 256
                          bits)

     Digital Signature:   Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm -
                          FIPS 186-2 (using the curves with 256 and 
                          384-bit prime moduli)

     Key Exchange:        Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic
                          Curve MQV Draft NIST Special Publication 
                          800-56 (using the curves with 256 and 
                          384-bit prime moduli)

     Hashing:             Secure Hash Algorithm - FIPS 180-2
                          (using SHA-256 and SHA-384)
</artwork>
All implementations of Suite B must, at a minimum, include AES with
128-bit keys, the 256-bit prime modulus elliptic curve and SHA-256 as
a common mode for widespread interoperability.
</t>
</list>
<t>The 128-bit security level corresponds to an elliptic curve size of 256 bits, AES-128, and SHA-256. The 192-bit security level corresponds to an elliptic
curve size of 384 bits, AES-256, and SHA-384.
</t>
</section>
<section title="Suite B Compliance Requirements">
<t>
To be considered "Suite B compatible" at least one of the Galois
Counter Mode (GCM) CipherSuites defined in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-tls-ecc-new-mac"/> MUST be negotiated.  In compliance
with the guidance in the Suite B Fact Sheet every TLS implementation
of Suite B SHOULD implement TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.
</t>
<section title="Security Levels">
<t>
As described in <xref target="intro"/>, Suite B specifies two 
security levels, 128 and 192 bit. The following table lists the
security levels for each cipher suite:
<texttable>
<ttcol>Cipher Suite</ttcol>
<ttcol>Security Level</ttcol>
<c>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</c><c>128</c>
<c>TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256</c><c>128</c>
<c>TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</c><c>192</c>
<c>TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384</c><c>192</c>
</texttable>
</t>
</section>
<section title="Acceptable Curves" anchor="acceptable.curves">
<t>
RFC 4492 defines a variety of elliptic curves. For cipher suites
defined in this specification, only secp256r1 (23) or
secp384r1 (24) may be used. (These are the same curves that
appear in FIPS 186-2 <xref target="DSS"/> as P-256 and P-384, respectively.)
For cipher suites at the 128-bit
security level, secp256r1 MUST be used. For cipher suites at
the 192-bit security level, secp384r1 MUST be used.
RFC 4492 requires that uncompressed (0) form be supported.
ansiX962_compressed_prime(1) point formats MAY be supported.
</t>
<t>
Clients desiring to negotiate only a Suite B-compliant connection
MUST generate a "Supported Elliptic 
Curves Extension" containing only the allowed curves. These
curves MUST match the cipher suite security levels being offered.
Clients which are willing to do both Suite B-compliant and
non-Suite B-compliant connections MAY omit the extension or
send the extension but offer other curves as well as the appropriate
Suite B ones.
</t>
<t>
Servers desiring to negotiate a Suite B-compliant connection
SHOULD check for the presence of the
extension, but MUST NOT negotiate inappropriate curves even
if they are offered by the client. This allows a Client which
is willing to do either Suite B-compliant or non-Suite B-compliant
modes to interoperate with a server which will only do Suite B-compliant
modes. If the client does not advertise an acceptable curve,
the server MUST generate a fatal "handshake_failure" alert
and terminate the connection. Clients MUST check the chosen
curve to make sure it is acceptable.
</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
Most of the security considerations for this document are described
in TLS 1.2 <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis"/>, RFC 4492
<xref target="RFC4492"/>, <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-rsa-aes-gcm"/>,
and <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-ecc-new-mac"/>.
Readers should consult those documents.
</t>
<t>
In order to meet the goal of a consistent security level for the
entire cipher suite, in Suite B mode TLS implementations MUST ONLY
use the curves defined in <xref target="acceptable.curves"/>.
Otherwise, it is possible to have a set of symmetric algorithms
with much weaker or stronger security properties than the 
asymmetric (ECC) algorithms.
