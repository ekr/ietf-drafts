Abstract

   In theory SSLv3 and TLS provide for automatic version negotiation.
   However, experience has shown that broken servers sometimes fail when
   clients offer higher versions than they support.  Some clients (in
   particular Web Browser clients) respond to these failures by rolling
   back to a lower version, thus potentially allowing for a downgrade
   attack.  This document describes a set of cipher suites which may be
   included in the handshake to indicate version support and allow
   downgrade detection.

1.  Introduction

   In theory SSLv3 and TLS [RFC5246] provide for automatic version
   negotiation.  This mechanism works by having the client offer the
   highest version it supports (in the ClientHello) and then the server
   selects the highest common version.  Unfortunately, experience has
   shown that broken servers sometimes fail when clients offer higher
   versions than they support.  These failures manifest as TLS handshake
   failures.

   ` Some clients (in particular Web Browser clients) respond to these
   failures by initiating a new connection with a lower version.
   However, because the attacker can simulate such a failure without
   having access to the server's keying material, this means that an
   attacker can force the client back to an earlier version of TLS than
   the client and server mutually support.  The ordinary TLS anti-
   downgrade mechanisms such as Finished do not provide protection here
   because the first handshake does not complete at all.

   The natural defense against this attack is to have a "maximum
   version" indicator which the client can safely send even to downrev
   servers but which upgraded servers can check and will thus allow
   downgrade detection.  [Note that SSLv3 defines such a mechanism in
   the PKCS#1 padding for use to detect SSLv3->SSLv2 rollback.]  The
   natural location for this indicator is in the cipher suite list as
   servers already ignore unknown cipher suites.  (An extension is not
   suitable as extension-intolerance is one form of incompatibility).


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Maximum Version Cipher Suites

   This document defines six new cipher suites which are used to
   indicate the maximum version that the client supports.  These cipher
   suites are:

3.1.  Client Behavior

   A client compliant with this specification MUST add to its cipher
   suite list the SCSV value which corresponds to the highest TLS
   version it supports for the TLS mode (TLS or DTLS) it is attempting.
   In cases where a previous attempt to connect to this server has
   failed and the client is now retrying with a lower version, the
   client MUST still indicate the highest version, not the lower version
   it is now attempting.  Note that when a user has configured the
   client to disable a specific version, it is the highest configured
   version which must be advertised.  No more than one SCSV value may be
   present.

3.2.  Server Behavior

   A server compliant with this specification MUST inspect the cipher
   suites offered by the client to determine if an SCSV value is
   present.

   o  If no SCSV value is present, then the server proceeds with the
      handshake as usual.
   o  If more than one SCSV value is present then the server MUST
      terminate the connection with a fatal "illegal_parameter" alert.
   o  If the SCSV value is present and is equal to
      ClientHello.client_version, then the server continues the
      handshake as usual.
   o  If the SCSV value is present and is not equal to
      ClientHello.client_version, then the server MUST terminate the
      handshake with a fatal "handshake_failure" alert.

   Note that if a server (a) improperly handles version and/or extension

   negotiation and (b) implements this specification will experience a
   hard failure with a newer client which falls back to an older
   version.  This is a feature rather than a bug.  It is important that
   new implementations perform correct version negotiation.  The only
   purpose of this specification is to enable newer clients and servers
   to detect downgrade attack while not disabling newer clients from
   commnunications with older, broken, servers.


4.  Security Considerations

   TLS already provides a mechanism for suppressing downgrade attacks
   when both implementations are compliant.  This mechanism allows
   servers to detect the situation where they are communicating with a
   client which has been forced to offer a fresh handshake with a lower
   version number by an attacker simulating non-compliance.

   As with the normal TLS anti-downgrade mechanism, the security of this
   mechanism rests on the security of the Finished handshake
   calculation.  If that fails, then a downgrade attack is still
   possible.  Thus, security is only provided down to the security of
   the Finished handshake of the weakest mutually supported TLS version.
   Currently, the Finished handshakes of all TLS versions are believed
   to be sufficiently secure.  However, if future research weakens one
   of the Finished handshakes to the point where it cannot reliably
   detect tampering with the handshake messages, then downgrade attack
   to that version will be possible and defense will require disabling
   that TLS version.
