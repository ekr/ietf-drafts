Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


1.  Introduction

   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [10] is a profile of the
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [1] which can provide
   confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection to RTP
   traffic and to the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport
   Control Protocol (RTCP).  SRTP does not provide key management
   functionality but instead depends on external key management.

   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [5] is a channel security
   protocol that offers integrated key management, parameter
   negotiation, and secure data transfer.  Because DTLS's data transfer
   protocol is generic, it is less highly optimized for use with RTP
   than is SRTP, which has been specifically tuned for that purpose.
   This document describes an SRTP extension for DTLS which combine the
   the performance and encryption flexibility benefits of SRTP with the
   flexibility and convenience of DTLS's integrated key and association
   management.  This extension MUST only be used when the data being
   transported is RTP and RTCP [4].

   The key points of our approach are as follows:
   o  New mode negotiated via DTLS extension mechanism.
   o  DTLS extension used to negotiate SRTP algorithms.
   o  Application data is protected using SRTP.
   o  Other content types are protected using the usual DTLS record
      format.
   o  The DTLS handshake is used to establish keying material and
      algorithm parameters for SRTP.
   o  The DTLS pseudo-random function (PRF) is used to generate the SRTP
      traffic encryption keys.
   The next section provides details of the new extension.

3.  Protocol Description

   In this section we provide a description of the new protocol elements
   introduced by this proposal.

3.1.  Usage Model

   Our general model is to have a single DTLS association (called a

   "connection" in TLS jargon) for each media channel (pair of
   unidirectional SRTP flows).  [TODO:  is this the right terminology?]
   A description of how to indicate this in SIP and SDP and authenticate
   the endpoints using fingerprints can be found in [7] and [6].

   In a naive implementation, this results in new DTLS session
   establishment (complete with public key cryptography) for each media
   channel.  A superior approach is to establish single DTLS connection
   in order to create the DTLS session and then use DTLS session
   resumption to establish DTLS connections for any additional media
   channels.  This allows the amortization of the expensive public key
   cryptography operations over multiple handshakes.

   One issue that arises in this context is multiple RTP sender over the
   same DTLS channel.  In order to avoid the "two-time pad" problem,
   each sender over the same DTLS association MUST use a distinct SSRC
   value, as described in Section 9.1 of RFC 3711.

3.2.  use_srtp Extension

   In order to negotiate the use of SRTP data protection, clients MAY
   include an extension of type "use_srtp" in the extended client hello.
   The "extension_data" field of this extension contains the list of
   acceptable SRTP protection profiles, as indicated below.

   Servers that receive an extended hello containing a "use_srtp"
   extension, MAY agree to use SRTP by including an extension of type
   "use_srtp", with the chosen protection profile in the extended server
   hello.  This process is shown below.

         Client                                               Server

         ClientHello + use_srtp       -------->
                                              ServerHello + use_srtp
                                                        Certificate*

                                                 CertificateRequest*

         SRTP packets                 <------->      SRTP packets

   "application_data" in the newly negotiated association (i.e., after
   the change_cipher_spec) SHOULD be protected using SRTP.  [TODO:  Note
   that you actually can in theory intermix DTLS "application_data"
   traffic as well.  Is there any value here?]  Records of type other
   than "application_data" MUST use ordinary DTLS framing.  When the
   "use_srtp" extension is in effect, implementations MUST NOT place
   more than one "record" per datagram.  (This is only meaningful from
   the perspective of DTLS because SRTP is inherently oriented towards
   one payload per packet, but is stated purely for clarification.)

3.2.1.  use_srtp Extension Definition

   The client MUST fill the extension_data field of the the "use_rtp"
   extension with an SRTPProtectionProfiles value:

      uint8 SRTPProtectionProfile[2];

      SRTPProtectionProfiles SRTPProtectionProfiles;

   This list indicates the SRTP protection profiles that the client is
   willing to support, listed in descending order of preference.

   If the server is willing to accept the use_srtp extension, it MUST
   respond with its own "use_srtp" extension in the ExtendedServerHello.
   The extension_data field MUST be a SRTPProtectionProfile which
   contains the protection profile which the server has chosen for use
   with this connection.  The server MUST NOT select a value which the
   client has not offered.  If there is no shared profile, the server
   should not return the use_srtp extension at which point the
   connection falls back to the negotiated DTLS cipher suite.  If that
   is not acceptable the server should return an appropriate DTLS alert.

3.2.2.  SRTP Protection Profiles

   This document defines the following SRTP protection profiles.

      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_80 ={0x00, 0x01};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_32 ={0x00, 0x02};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_F8_SHA1_80 ={0x00, 0x03};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_F8_SHA1_32 ={0x00, 0x04};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_NULL_SHA1_80      ={0x00, 0x05};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_NULL_SHA1_32      ={0x00, 0x06};

   The following table indicates the SRTP transform parameters for each
   protection profile:

   [TODO:  David, can you fill in whatever fixed parameters we need
   please?]

   New SRTPProtectionProfile values must be defined by RFC 2434
   Standards Action.  See Section Section 5 for IANA Considerations.

3.3.  Key Derivation

   When SRTP mode is in effect, different keys are used for ordinary
   DTLS record protection and SRTP record protection.  These keys are
   generated as additional keying material at the end of the DTLS key
   block.  Thus, the key block becomes:

      client_write_MAC_secret[SecurityParameters.hash_size]
      server_write_MAC_secret[SecurityParameters.hash_size]
      client_write_key[SecurityParameters.key_material_length]
      server_write_key[SecurityParameters.key_material_length]
      srtp_client_write_MAC_secret[SRTPSecurityParameters.hash_size]
      srtp_server_write_MAC_secret[SRTPSecurityParameters.hash_size]
      srtp_client_write_key[SRTPSecurityParameters.key_material_length]
      srtp_server_write_key[SRTPSecurityParameters.key_material_length]
      srtp_client_write_salt_secret[SRTPSecurityParameters.salt_size]
      srtp_server_write_salt_secret[SRTPSecurityParameters.salt_size]

   [TODO:  I think we can just use the same key sizes for the algorithms
   as does DTLS.  Is there a problem here I missed?]

   The last six values are mapped directly onto the SRTP values for each
   transform.  The following table shows the mapping in the client to
   server direction:

               +------------------------------+------------+
               | DTLS Value                   | SRTP Value |
               +------------------------------+------------+
               | srtp_client_write_MAC_secret |        k_a |
               | srtp_client_write_key        |        k_e |

               | srtp_client_write_salt       |        k_s |
               +------------------------------+------------+

   Because we generate the SRTP keys directly, the SRTP key derivation
   mechanism described in Section 4.3 of [10] is not used.

3.4.  Key Usage Limitations

   [TODO:  David McGrew]

3.5.  Data Protection

   Once the DTLS handshake has completed the peers can send RTP and RTCP
   over the newly created channel.  We describe the transmission process
   first followed by the reception process.

3.5.1.  Transmission

   DTLS and TLS define a number of record content types.  In ordinary
   TLS/DTLS, all data is protected using the same record encoding and
   mechanisms.  When the mechanism described in this document is in
   effect, this is modified so that data of type "application_data"
   (used to transport data traffic) is encrypted using SRTP rather than
   the standard TLS record encoding.

   When a user of DTLS wishes to send an RTP packet in SRTP mode it
   delivers it to the DTLS implementation as a single write of type
   "application_data".  The DTLS implementation then invokes the
   processing described in RFC 3711 Sections 3 and 4.  The resulting
   SRTP packet is then sent directly on the wire as a single datagram
   with no DTLS framing.  This provides the same bits on the wire
   representation as SRTP for the data.  Note that the RTP sequence
   number rather than the DTLS sequence number is used for these
   packets.

   [TODO:  How fixed is the SRTP MAC?  Could we include the DTLS record
   header in the MAC somehow just to make absolutely sure that we know
   the content type?  That seems like it would be nice from a security
   perspective for maximal ambiguity, even though the different keys
   thing does provide a fair amount of insulation.]

3.5.2.  Reception

   In ordinary DTLS, the receiver can unambiguously determine the type
   of the record from the DTLS record header.  However when SRTP and
   DTLS data is mixed over the same channel, the recipient must first
   determine which decryption mechanism to use.  This can be done
   unambiguously using the following procedure.

Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


   1.  Assume that the datagram is a DTLS record.
   2.  If the first byte does not match a known DTLS content type go to
       step 6.
   3.  If the version field does not match the current version go to
       step 6.
   4.  If the length does not match the rest of the record, go to step
       6.
   5.  Attempt to decrypt and verify the DTLS record--omitting the
       replay check.  If this process succeeds, the record must be DTLS.
       Deliver it to the rest of the DTLS implementation.
   6.  Assume that the datagram is an SRTP packet and follow the
       procedure of Section 3 of RFC 3711.  Note that the replay
       detection check specified in DTLS SHOULD NOT be done for these
       packets.  If anti-replay is desired SRTP anti-replay mechanisms
       SHOULD be used.

   The first byte of a DTLS packet is "Type" which can currently have
   values of 20,21,22, and 23 as defined in ContentType declaration in
   [8].  It is reasonable to expect the first byte to remain under 64
   and greater than 1.  For RTP the first byte has a value that is 196
   or above.  Thus, in general, the type check specified in step (2) is
   sufficient for unambigous interpretation, and checks (3), (4), and
   (5) are merely fallbacks in case of the unlikely event that the
   headers do change enough to make this first check less than
   completely definitive.

   If this procedure does not result in a successful verification and
   reception, the datagram SHOULD be silently discarded.  For testing
   and debugging purposes it MAY be desirable to generate an
   "invalid_MAC" alert, as specified in Section 4.1.2.1 of [5].

3.6.  Rehandshake and Re-key

   Rekeying in DTLS is accomplished by performing a new handshake over
   the existing DTLS channel.  This handshake can be performed in
   parallel with data transport, so no interruption of the data flow is
   required.  Once the handshake is finished, all records, including
   application_data records, simply switch over to the new keys.

   Because of packet reordering, data from the previous association can
   appear on the wire after the handshake has completed.  This means
   that receivers must maintain both sets of keys for some time in order
   to be able to decrypt and verify older data records.  In the ordinary
   DTLS record layer, this is accomplished by having an "epoch" value in
   each record that indicates which handshake the record is from.
   However, no such explicit field is present in SRTP.

   One approach would be to simply place the DTLS epoch value in the

   Master Key Identifier, but this would add two bytes to every packet,
   which seems undesirable, given that rekeying is an infrequent event.
   Instead, we propose adapting the rollover counter management
   algorithm of Section 3.3.1 of RFC 3711.  When a handshake has just
   been performed (during the MSL period after the handshake), the
   implementation SHOULD retain the pre-handshake set of keys.  When a
   new packet arrives, it should try decrypting/authenticating with both
   sets of keys (using the sequence number to guess which key to try
   first).  If either set succeeds, it should pass on the packet,
   otherwise it should be rejected.  Once the MSL has expired, the
   previous keys can be discarded.  This algorithm is easily extensible
   to the case where several handshakes happen in close succession, but
   such practice is NOT RECOMMENDED.


4.  Security Considerations

   The use of multiple data protection framings negotiated in the same
   handshake creates some complexities, which are discussed here.

4.1.  Security of Negotiation

   One concern here is that attackers might be able to implement a bid-
   down attack forcing the peers to use ordinary DTLS rather than SRTP.
   However, because the negotiation of this extension is performed in
   the DTLS handshake, it is protected by the Finished messages.
   Therefore, any bid-down attack is automatically detected, which
   reduces this to a denial of service attack--which any attacker who
   can control the channel can always mount.

4.2.  Security of Established Keys

   [TODO:  David, can you say something about NIST, the PRF, etc...?]

4.3.  Framing Confusion

   Because two different framing formats are used, there is concern that
   an attacker could convince the receiver to treat an SRTP-framed RTP
   packet as a DTLS record (e.g., a handshake message) or vice versa.
   This attack is prevented by using different keys for MAC verification
   for each type of data.  Therefore, this type of attack reduces to
   being able to forge a packet with a valid MAC, which violates a basic
   security invariant of both DTLS and SRTP.

   As an additional defense against injection into the DTLS handshake
   channel, the DTLS record type is included in the MAC.  Therefore, an
   SRTP record would be treated as an unknown type and ignored.  (See
   Section 6 of [8]).

Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


4.4.  Sequence Number Interactions

   As described in Section Section 3.5.1, the SRTP and DTLS sequence
   number spaces are distinct.  This means that it is not possible to
   unambiguously order a given DTLS control record with respect to an
   SRTP packet.  In general, this is relevant in two situations:  alerts
   and rehandshake.

4.4.1.  Alerts

   Because DTLS handshake and change_cipher_spec messages share the same
   sequence number space as alerts, they can be ordered correctly.
   Because DTLS alerts are inherently unreliable and SHOULD NOT be
   generated as a response to data packets, reliable sequencing between
   SRTP packets and DTLS alerts is not an important feature.  However,
   implementations which wish to use DTLS alerts to signal problems with
   the SRTP encoding SHOULD simply act on alerts as soon as they are
   received and assume that they refer to the temporally contiguous
   stream.  Such implementations MUST check for alert retransmission and
   discard retransmitted alerts to avoid overreacting to replay attacks.

4.4.2.  Rehandshake

   Because the rehandshake transition algorithm specified in Section
   Section 3.6 requires trying multiple sets of keys, it slightly
   weakens the authentication.  For instance, if an n-bit MAC is used
   and k different sets of keys are present, then the MAC is weakened by
   log_2(k) bits to n - log_2(k).  In practice, since the number of keys
   used will be very small and the MACs in use are typically strong (the
   default for SRTP is 80 bits) the decrease in security involved here
   is minimal.

   Another concern here is that this algorithm slightly increases the
   work factor on the receiver because it needs to attempt multiple
   validations.  However, again, the number of potential keys will be
   very small (and the attacker cannot force it to be larger) and this
   technique is already used for rollover counter management, so the
   authors do not consider this to be a serious flaw.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document a new extension for DTLS, in accordance with [9]:

         enum { use_srtp (??) } ExtensionType;

   [[ NOTE:  This value needs to be assigned by IANA ]]

Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


   This extension MUST only be used with DTLS.

   Section Section 3.2.2 requires that all SRTPProtectionProfile values
   be defined by RFC 2434 Standards Action.  IANA SHOULD create a DTLS
   SRTPProtectionProfile registry initially populated with values from
   Section Section 3.2.2 of this document.  Future values MUST be
   allocated via Standards Action as described in [3]
