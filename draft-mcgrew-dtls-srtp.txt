Abstract

   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is a profile of the Real-
   time Transport Protocol which can provide confidentiality, message
   authentication, and replay protection to the RTP traffic and to the
   control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control Protocol
   (RTCP).  This document describes a method of using DTLS key
   management for SRTP by using a new extension that indicates that SRTP
   is to be used for data protection, and which establishes SRTP keys.

Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


1.  Introduction

   Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [11] is a profile of the
   Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [1] which can provide
   confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection to RTP
   traffic and to the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport
   Control Protocol (RTCP).  SRTP does not provide key management
   functionality but instead depends on external key management.

   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [5] is a channel security
   protocol that offers integrated key management, parameter
   negotiation, and secure data transfer.  Because DTLS's data transfer
   protocol is generic, it is less highly optimized for use with RTP
   than is SRTP, which has been specifically tuned for that purpose.
   This document describes an SRTP extension for DTLS which combine the
   the performance and encryption flexibility benefits of SRTP with the
   flexibility and convenience of DTLS's integrated key and association
   management.  This extension MUST only be used when the data being
   transported is RTP and RTCP [4].

   The key points of our approach are as follows:
   o  Application data is protected using SRTP.
   o  The DTLS handshake is used to establish keying material,
      algorithms, and parameters for SRTP.
   o  The DTLS pseudo-random function (PRF) is used to generate the SRTP
      encryption and authentication keys.
   o  A DTLS extension used to negotiate SRTP algorithms.
   o  Other content types are protected using the usual DTLS record
      format.
   The next section provides details of the new extension.

3.  Protocol Description

   In this section we provide a description of the new protocol elements
   introduced by this proposal.

3.1.  Usage Model

   DTLS-SRTP is defined for point-to-point media sessions, in which
   there are exactly two participants.  A DTLS-SRTP session corresponds



McGrew & Rescorla      Expires September 21, 2006               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


   to a pair of complementary unidirectional RTP flows.  Between a
   single pair of participants, there may be multiple media sessions;
   each session MUST have its own DTLS-SRTP session.  Additionally, each
   RTCP flow is protected by a separate DTLS-SRTP session.  One or both
   of the DTLS-SRTP session participants MAY be RTP mixers.  Each DTLS-
   SRTP session contains a single DLTS association (called a
   "connection" in TLS jargon).

   A DTLS-SRTP session can be indicated by an external signaling
   protocol like SIP.  When the signaling exchange is integrity-
   protected (e.g when SIP Identity protection via digital signatures is
   used), DTLS-SRTP can leverage this integrity guarantee to provide
   complete security of the media stream.  A description of how to
   indicate DTLS-SRTP sessions in SIP and SDP, and how to authenticate
   the endpoints using fingerprints can be found in [7] and [6].

   Each RTP stream participates in a single DTLS session.  In a naive
   implementation, this results in new DTLS session establishment
   (complete with public key cryptography) for each media channel.  For
   example, a videophone may be sending both an audio stream and a video
   stream, each of which would use a separate DTLS session establishment
   exchange, which would proceed in parallel.  As an optimization, the
   DTLS-SRTP implementation SHOULD use the following strategy:  a single
   DTLS connection is established, and all other DTLS sessions wait
   until that connection is established before proceeding with their
   session establishment exchanges.  This strategy allows the later
   sessions to use the DTLS session re-start, which allows the
   amortization of the expensive public key cryptography operations over
   multiple DTLS session establishment instances.

   One issue that arises in this context is multiple RTP sender over the
   same DTLS channel.  In order to avoid the "two-time pad" problem (as
   described in Section 9.1 of RFC 3711), distinct keys are used for
   each participant in the DTLS-SRTP session.

3.2.  use_srtp Extension

   In order to negotiate the use of SRTP data protection, clients MAY
   include an extension of type "use_srtp" in the extended client hello.
   The "extension_data" field of this extension contains the list of
   acceptable SRTP protection profiles, as indicated below.

   Servers that receive an extended hello containing a "use_srtp"
   extension, MAY agree to use SRTP by including an extension of type
   "use_srtp", with the chosen protection profile in the extended server
   hello.  This process is shown below.

         SRTP packets                 <------->      SRTP packets

   Once the "use_srtp" extension is negotiated, packets of type
   "application_data" in the newly negotiated association (i.e., after
   the change_cipher_spec) SHOULD be protected using SRTP.  Records of
   type other than "application_data" MUST use ordinary DTLS framing.
   When the "use_srtp" extension is in effect, implementations MUST NOT
   place more than one "record" per datagram.  (This is only meaningful
   from the perspective of DTLS because SRTP is inherently oriented
   towards one payload per packet, but is stated purely for
   clarification.)

3.2.1.  use_srtp Extension Definition

   The client MUST fill the extension_data field of the the "use_rtp"
   extension with an SRTPProtectionProfiles value:

      uint8 SRTPProtectionProfile[2];

      SRTPProtectionProfiles SRTPProtectionProfiles;

   This list indicates the SRTP protection profiles that the client is
   willing to support, listed in descending order of preference.

   If the server is willing to accept the use_srtp extension, it MUST
   respond with its own "use_srtp" extension in the ExtendedServerHello.
   The extension_data field MUST be a SRTPProtectionProfile which
   contains the protection profile which the server has chosen for use
   with this connection.  The server MUST NOT select a value which the
   client has not offered.  If there is no shared profile, the server
   should not return the use_srtp extension at which point the
   connection falls back to the negotiated DTLS cipher suite.  If that
   is not acceptable the server should return an appropriate DTLS alert.

3.2.2.  SRTP Protection Profiles

   A DTLS-SRTP SRTP Protection Profile defines the parameters and
   options that are in effect for the SRTP processing.  This document
   defines the following SRTP protection profiles.

      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_80 ={0x00, 0x01};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_32 ={0x00, 0x02};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_F8_SHA1_80 ={0x00, 0x03};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_AES128_F8_SHA1_32 ={0x00, 0x04};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_NULL_SHA1_80      ={0x00, 0x05};
      SRTPProtectionProfile SRTP_NULL_SHA1_32      ={0x00, 0x06};

   The following list indicates the SRTP transform parameters for each
   protection profile.  The parameters cipher_key_length,
   cipher_salt_length, auth_key_length, and auth_tag_length express the
   number of bits in the values to which they refer.  The
   maximum_lifetime parameter indicates the maximum number of packets
   that can be protected with each single set of keys when the parameter
   profile is in use.

   SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_80
         cipher:  AES_128_CM
         cipher_key_length:  128

         auth_tag_length:  80
   SRTP_AES128_CM_SHA1_32 Because of the short authentication tag
      provides limited authentication, this profile SHOULD NOT be used

         maximum_lifetime:  2^48
         auth_function:  HMAC-SHA1
         auth_key_length:  160
         auth_tag_length:  80
   SRTP_AES128_NULL_SHA1_32 Because the short authentication tag
      provides limited authentication, this profile SHOULD NOT be used
      with RTCP.
         cipher:  NULL
         cipher_key_length:  0
         cipher_salt_length:  0
         maximum_lifetime:  2^48
         auth_function:  HMAC-SHA1
         auth_key_length:  160
         auth_tag_length:  32
   With all of these SRTP Parameter profiles, the following SRTP options
   are in effect:
      The TLS Key Derivation Function (KDF) is used, and the SRTP
      default KDF is not used.
      The Key Derivation Rate (KDR) is equal to zero.  Thus, keys are
      not re-derived based on the sequence number.
      For all other parameters, the default values are used.
   All SRTP parameters that are not determined by the SRTP Protection
   Profile MAY be established via the signaling system.  In particular,
   the relative order of Forward Error Correction and SRTP processing,
   and a suggested SRTP replay window size SHOULD be established in this
   manner.  An example of how these parameters can be defined for SDP by
   is contained in [8].

   New SRTPProtectionProfile values must be defined by RFC 2434
   Standards Action.  See Section Section 5 for IANA Considerations.

3.3.  Key Derivation

   When SRTP mode is in effect, different keys are used for ordinary
   DTLS record protection and SRTP record protection.  These keys are
   generated as additional keying material at the end of the DTLS key
   block.  Thus, the key block becomes:

   client_write_MAC_secret[SecurityParameters.hash_size]
   server_write_MAC_secret[SecurityParameters.hash_size]
   client_write_key[SecurityParameters.key_material_length]
   server_write_key[SecurityParameters.key_material_length]
   srtp_client_write_MAC_secret[SRTPSecurityParams.auth_key_length]
   srtp_server_write_MAC_secret[SRTPSecurityParams.auth_key_length]
   srtp_client_write_key[SRTPSecurityParams.cipher_key_length]
   srtp_server_write_key[SRTPSecurityParams.cipher_key_length]
   srtp_client_write_salt_secret[SRTPSecurityParams.cipher_salt_length]
   srtp_server_write_salt_secret[SRTPSecurityParams.cipher_salt_length]

   The last six values are mapped directly onto the SRTP values for each
   transform.  The following table shows the mapping in the client to
   server direction:

               +------------------------------+------------+
               | DTLS Value                   | SRTP Value |
               +------------------------------+------------+
               | srtp_client_write_MAC_secret |        k_a |
               | srtp_client_write_key        |        k_e |
               | srtp_client_write_salt       |        k_s |
               +------------------------------+------------+

   Because we generate the SRTP keys directly, the SRTP key derivation
   mechanism described in Section 4.3 of [11] is not used.

3.4.  Key Scope

   The SRTP cipher and authentication function keys provided by DTLS-
   SRTP are used as follows.
      The srtp_client_write_key is used to encrypt traffic that is sent
      by the client.  It MUST NOT be used in encryption by the server.
      The srtp_client_write_salt_secret is used to randomize IV by some
      SRTP ciphers; may be used as input to the encryption of traffic
      that is sent by the client.  It MUST NOT be used in encryption by
      the server.
      The srtp_client_write_MAC_secret is used to generate
      authentication tags for traffic that is sent by the client.  It
      MUST NOT be used to generate tags for traffic that is sent by the
      server.

Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


      The srtp_server_write_key is used to encrypt traffic that is sent
      by the server.  It MUST NOT be used in encryption by the client.
      The srtp_server_write_salt_secret is used to randomize IV by some
      SRTP ciphers; may be used as input to the encryption of traffic
      that is sent by the server.  It MUST NOT be used in encryption by
      the client.
      The srtp_server_write_MAC_secret is used to generate
      authentication tags for traffic that is sent by the server.  It
      MUST NOT be used to generate tags for traffic that is sent by the
      client.

   The "use_srtp" extension conveys the RTP sequence number at which the
   SRTP keys derived after a DTLS handshake will be used.  Because of
   the possibility of packet reorder, DTLS-SRTP implementations SHOULD
   store multiple SRTP keys sets during a re-key in order to avoid the
   need for receivers to drop packets for which they lack a key.

3.5.  Key Usage Limitations

   The maximum_lifetime parameter in the SRTP protection profile
   indicates the maximum number of packets that can be protected with
   each single encryption and authentication key.  Each profile defines
   its own limit.  When this limit is reached, a new DTLS session SHOULD
   be used to establish replacement keys, and SRTP implementations MUST
   NOT use the existing keys for the processing of either outbound or
   inbound traffic.

3.6.  Data Protection

   Once the DTLS handshake has completed the peers can send RTP and RTCP
   over the newly created channel.  We describe the transmission process
   first followed by the reception process.

   Within each RTP session, SRTP processing MUST NOT take place before
   the DTLS handshake completes.

3.6.1.  Transmission

   DTLS and TLS define a number of record content types.  In ordinary
   TLS/DTLS, all data is protected using the same record encoding and
   mechanisms.  When the mechanism described in this document is in
   effect, this is modified so that data of type "application_data"
   (used to transport data traffic) is encrypted using SRTP rather than
   the standard TLS record encoding.

   When a user of DTLS wishes to send an RTP packet in SRTP mode it
   delivers it to the DTLS implementation as a single write of type
   "application_data".  The DTLS implementation then invokes the

   processing described in RFC 3711 Sections 3 and 4.  The resulting
   SRTP packet is then sent directly on the wire as a single datagram
   with no DTLS framing.  This provides the same bits on the wire
   representation as SRTP for the data.  Note that the RTP sequence
   number rather than the DTLS sequence number is used for these
   packets.

3.6.2.  Reception

   In ordinary DTLS, the receiver can unambiguously determine the type
   of the record from the DTLS record header.  However when SRTP and
   DTLS data is mixed over the same channel, the recipient must first
   determine which decryption mechanism to use.  This can be done
   unambiguously using the following procedure.
   1.  Assume that the datagram is a DTLS record.
   2.  If the first byte does not match a known DTLS content type go to
       step 6.
   3.  If the version field does not match the current version go to
       step 6.
   4.  If the length does not match the rest of the record, go to step
       6.
   5.  Attempt to decrypt and verify the DTLS record--omitting the
       replay check.  If this process succeeds, the record must be DTLS.
       Deliver it to the rest of the DTLS implementation.
   6.  Assume that the datagram is an SRTP packet and follow the
       procedure of Section 3 of RFC 3711.  Note that the replay
       detection check specified in DTLS SHOULD NOT be done for these
       packets.  If anti-replay is desired SRTP anti-replay mechanisms
       SHOULD be used.

   The first byte of a DTLS packet is "Type" which can currently have
   values of 20,21,22, and 23 as defined in ContentType declaration in
   [9].  It is reasonable to expect the first byte to remain under 64
   and greater than 1.  For RTP the first byte has a value that is 196
   or above.  Thus, in general, the type check specified in step (2) is
   sufficient for unambigous interpretation, and checks (3), (4), and
   (5) are merely fallbacks in case of the unlikely event that the
   headers do change enough to make this first check less than
   completely definitive.

   If this procedure does not result in a successful verification and
   reception, the datagram SHOULD be silently discarded.  For testing
   and debugging purposes it MAY be desirable to generate an
   "invalid_MAC" alert, as specified in Section 4.1.2.1 of [5].

3.7.  Rehandshake and Re-key

   Rekeying in DTLS is accomplished by performing a new handshake over

Internet-Draft           SRTP Extension for DTLS              March 2006


   the existing DTLS channel.  This handshake can be performed in
   parallel with data transport, so no interruption of the data flow is
   required.  Once the handshake is finished, all records, including
   application_data records, simply switch over to the new keys.

   Because of packet reordering, data from the previous association can
   appear on the wire after the handshake has completed.  This means
   that receivers must maintain both sets of keys for some time in order
   to be able to decrypt and verify older data records.  In the ordinary
   DTLS record layer, this is accomplished by having an "epoch" value in
   each record that indicates which handshake the record is from.
   However, no such explicit field is present in SRTP.

   One approach would be to simply place the DTLS epoch value in the
   Master Key Identifier, but this would add two bytes to every packet,
   which seems undesirable, given that rekeying is an infrequent event.
   Instead, we propose adapting the rollover counter management
   algorithm of Section 3.3.1 of RFC 3711.  When a handshake has just
   been performed (during the MSL period after the handshake), the
   implementation SHOULD retain the pre-handshake set of keys.  When a
   new packet arrives, it should try decrypting/authenticating with both
   sets of keys (using the sequence number to guess which key to try
   first).  If either set succeeds, it should pass on the packet,
   otherwise it should be rejected.  Once the MSL has expired, the
   previous keys can be discarded.  This algorithm is easily extensible
   to the case where several handshakes happen in close succession, but
   such practice is NOT RECOMMENDED.


4.  Security Considerations

   The use of multiple data protection framings negotiated in the same
   handshake creates some complexities, which are discussed here.

4.1.  Security of Negotiation

   One concern here is that attackers might be able to implement a bid-
   down attack forcing the peers to use ordinary DTLS rather than SRTP.
   However, because the negotiation of this extension is performed in
   the DTLS handshake, it is protected by the Finished messages.
   Therefore, any bid-down attack is automatically detected, which
   reduces this to a denial of service attack--which any attacker who
   can control the channel can always mount.

4.2.  Security of Established Keys

   [TODO:  David, can you say something about NIST, the PRF, etc...?]

4.3.  Framing Confusion

   Because two different framing formats are used, there is concern that
   an attacker could convince the receiver to treat an SRTP-framed RTP
   packet as a DTLS record (e.g., a handshake message) or vice versa.
   This attack is prevented by using different keys for MAC verification
   for each type of data.  Therefore, this type of attack reduces to
   being able to forge a packet with a valid MAC, which violates a basic
   security invariant of both DTLS and SRTP.

   As an additional defense against injection into the DTLS handshake
   channel, the DTLS record type is included in the MAC.  Therefore, an
   SRTP record would be treated as an unknown type and ignored.  (See
   Section 6 of [9]).

4.4.  Sequence Number Interactions

   As described in Section Section 3.6.1, the SRTP and DTLS sequence
   number spaces are distinct.  This means that it is not possible to
   unambiguously order a given DTLS control record with respect to an
   SRTP packet.  In general, this is relevant in two situations:  alerts
   and rehandshake.

4.4.1.  Alerts

   Because DTLS handshake and change_cipher_spec messages share the same
   sequence number space as alerts, they can be ordered correctly.
   Because DTLS alerts are inherently unreliable and SHOULD NOT be
   generated as a response to data packets, reliable sequencing between
   SRTP packets and DTLS alerts is not an important feature.  However,
   implementations which wish to use DTLS alerts to signal problems with
   the SRTP encoding SHOULD simply act on alerts as soon as they are
   received and assume that they refer to the temporally contiguous
   stream.  Such implementations MUST check for alert retransmission and
   discard retransmitted alerts to avoid overreacting to replay attacks.

4.4.2.  Rehandshake

   Because the rehandshake transition algorithm specified in Section
   Section 3.7 requires trying multiple sets of keys, it slightly
   weakens the authentication.  For instance, if an n-bit MAC is used
   and k different sets of keys are present, then the MAC is weakened by
   log_2(k) bits to n - log_2(k).  In practice, since the number of keys
   used will be very small and the MACs in use are typically strong (the
   default for SRTP is 80 bits) the decrease in security involved here
   is minimal.

   Another concern here is that this algorithm slightly increases the

   work factor on the receiver because it needs to attempt multiple
   validations.  However, again, the number of potential keys will be
   very small (and the attacker cannot force it to be larger) and this
   technique is already used for rollover counter management, so the
   authors do not consider this to be a serious flaw.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document a new extension for DTLS, in accordance with [10]:

         enum { use_srtp (??) } ExtensionType;

   [[ NOTE:  This value needs to be assigned by IANA ]]

   This extension MUST only be used with DTLS.

   Section Section 3.2.2 requires that all SRTPProtectionProfile values
   be defined by RFC 2434 Standards Action.  IANA SHOULD create a DTLS
   SRTPProtectionProfile registry initially populated with values from
   Section Section 3.2.2 of this document.  Future values MUST be
   allocated via Standards Action as described in [3]
